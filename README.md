# Art Basel Design Tokens POC
This repository contains code to transform design tokens exported from Figma using token-transformer and style-dictionary, and create output for Android, iOS and the web.

The `tokens.json` file in the root is generated from Figma using [Tokens Studio for Figma (Figma Tokens)](https://tokens.studio/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/art-basel-design-token-poc.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn 
```

## Usage

The following scripts are available:

- build: cleans the output directory, converts the input design tokens, and generates the output files for Android, iOS and the web using style-dictionary.
- convert: converts the input design tokens from tokens.json to tokens/tokens-studio.json.
- clean: removes the build directory and the tokens/tokens-studio.json file.

To generate the output files, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated files will be located in the `build/` directory.
